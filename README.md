# WHAT'S MY NUMBER? â„–
Description:  
A simple project where users guess the random number between 1 and 20.   
The game shows messages when the guess is too high, too low, or out of range (greater than 20 or less than 1).   
For a better experience, the background color changes when you win or lose.  
The **Check** and **Again!** buttons allow users to check their guess or reset the game.
